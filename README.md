# Pethouse
Old school project made by me and some of my friends.

It's basically a web app of a fictitious virtual pethouse.

The whole point of the project was to supply all the services that a pethouse could offer, but using hte web app as a facilitator

It has some dump flaws, but i loved to code it back then.

And all the times that i remember about it, those good memories always came to mind.

It was a priciless experience.

Note: I was the one that basically coded the whole project lol
